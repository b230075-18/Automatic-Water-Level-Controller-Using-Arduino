Project: Automatic Water Level Controller using Arduino (Wokwi Simulation)



Tools/Technologies: Arduino UNO, C++, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), 16x2 LCD, EEPROM, Wokwi Simulator

Designed and simulated an automatic water level monitoring and pump control system using Arduino.

Utilized an ultrasonic sensor to measure real-time water level and display percentage on an LCD.

Implemented both manual and automatic pump control modes with user-selectable buttons.

Stored configurable maximum tank level in EEPROM for persistent reference across power cycles.

Displayed system status including water level %, pump status, and mode selection on a 16x2 LCD.

Ensured energy efficiency by automatically switching off the pump at full capacity.

Built and tested the complete circuit in Wokwi, enabling accurate simulation and verification.
